Coefficient Capitalism is a modern economic system that aims to achieve a perfect balance between various factors to create sustainable, equitable, and prosperous growth. A coefficient of 0 represents the ideal state of balance and harmony between economic, social, environmental, legal, and reputational factors, resulting in an economy that benefits all stakeholders without harming the environment or violating legal requirements.

Capitalism is an economic system that empowers individuals who have capital to fully develop, while those who do not have the possibility of accumulating capital are excluded or left in a precarious situation. The unequal distribution of profits generated by economic growth in capitalist economies is having a serious negative effect on democracy, since it undermines one of its fundamental principles: equality[3]. Income inequality is commonly measured by standard statistics as the Gini coefficient[1]. The Gini coefficient can theoretically range from 0.0 to 1.0, with higher values indicating greater inequality[2]. Different distributions of capital and labor describe different economic systems. Two polar systems are particularly relevant. In classical capitalism, a group of people receives incomes entirely from ownership, while another group receives incomes entirely from labor[4].

The Kuznets Curve predicts that as nations become wealthier, inequality initially rises and then declines[2]. However, economists hypothesized inequality would rise as workers transitioned from low-paying agricultural work to higher-paying industrial jobs but then decline as they moved into service jobs[2]. Unfortunately, this transition has stalled because educational costs have risen so much that less educated families are unable to gain the education required to complete the transition[2]. One interpretation of the data is that inequality naturally grows from unfettered capitalism[2].

In capitalist systems, norms of equality exist implicitly. The equality that exists in the standard form of utilitarianism can be interpreted as assigning the same positive coefficient to all individuals[5]. Classical capitalism tends to be associated with higher income inequality than liberal capitalism. Liberal capitalism lies between classical capitalism and homoploutic capitalism where compositional inequality is low and a society can be seen as homoploutic capitalism [4][1][5].

In Coefficient Capitalism, the factors of production go beyond the traditional focus on labor, capital goods, entrepreneurship, and natural resources. Instead, it also considers the impact on stakeholders and the environment, legal and reputational compliance, and social responsibility.

The SEPG coefficient measures Sustainable, Equitable, and Prosperous Growth as follows:

SEPG Coefficient = (Economic Output Score * (1 - Environmental Impact Score)) * (Social Impact Score / (Income Equality Score + Compliance Score + Reputation Score + Human Character Score))

The components of the SEPG coefficient are:

-   Economic Output Score: measures an entity's economic performance, with a score range of -1 to +1. A score of -1 indicates extremely poor economic output, with negative growth, and significant negative impact on stakeholders. A score of 0 indicates neutral economic output, with stable growth, and little to no impact on stakeholders. A score of +1 indicates extremely good economic output, with positive growth, and significant positive impact on stakeholders, but potential for unintended negative consequences such as overconsumption or resource depletion.
    
-   Environmental Impact Score: measures an entity's environmental impact, with a score range of -1 to +1. A score of -1 indicates significant negative environmental impact, with no initiatives to reduce carbon emissions, energy usage, or water consumption. A score of 0 indicates neutral environmental impact, with significant initiatives to reduce carbon emissions, energy usage, and water consumption, and positive impact on stakeholders. A score of +1 indicates significant positive environmental impact, with extensive initiatives to reduce carbon emissions, energy usage, and water consumption, and significant positive impact on stakeholders, but potential for unintended negative consequences such as increased costs or reduced convenience.
    
-   Social Impact Score: measures an entity's social responsibility, with a score range of -1 to +1. A score of -1 indicates significant negative social impact, with no support for local communities, employee welfare, or ethical practices. A score of 0 indicates neutral social impact, with significant support for local communities, employee welfare, and ethical practices, and positive impact on stakeholders. A score of +1 indicates significant positive social impact, with extensive support for local communities, employee welfare, and ethical practices, and significant positive impact on stakeholders, but potential for unintended negative consequences such as increased costs or reduced efficiency.
    
-   Income Equality Score: measures an entity's efforts to promote income equality, with a score range of -1 to +1. A score of -1 indicates significant income inequality, with no fair and transparent lending or investment options for all members. A score of 0 indicates perfect income equality, with fair and transparent lending and investment options for all members, and positive impact on stakeholders. A score of +1 indicates significant income equality, with no income gaps, fair and transparent lending and investment options for all members, and significant positive impact on stakeholders, but potential for unintended negative consequences such as decreased motivation or reduced innovation.
    
-   Compliance Score: measures an entity's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, with a score range of -1 to +1. A score of -1 indicates significant non-compliance, with a history of legal violations or unethical practices. A score of 0 indicates neutral compliance, with a history of minimal legal or regulatory issues. A score of +1 indicates high compliance, with a strong track record of adherence to legal and regulatory requirements, and positive impact on stakeholders, but potential for unintended negative consequences such as increased costs or reduced efficiency.

-   Reputation Score: measures an entity's reputation and public perception, with a score range of -1 to +1. A score of -1 indicates a poor reputation, with negative media attention, public criticism, or scandals. A score of 0 indicates a neutral reputation, with no significant positive or negative media attention. A score of +1 indicates a positive reputation, with positive media attention, public trust, and strong brand reputation, resulting in positive impact on stakeholders, but potential for unintended negative consequences such as increased pressure or scrutiny.

-   Human Character Score: measures an entity's customer satisfaction and loyalty, with a score range of -1 to +1. A score of -1 indicates significant customer dissatisfaction, with a history of complaints, negative reviews, or low customer loyalty. A score of 0 indicates neutral customer satisfaction, with a history of average customer feedback or loyalty. A score of +1 indicates high customer satisfaction, with positive customer feedback, high customer loyalty, and positive impact on stakeholders, but potential for unintended negative consequences such as increased costs or reduced innovation.

Incorporating these additional factors into the SEPG coefficient provides a more comprehensive and holistic assessment of an entity's sustainable, equitable, and prosperous growth. By considering not only economic, social, and environmental factors, but also legal, reputational, and Human Character factors, the SEPG coefficient can more accurately reflect an entity's overall impact on stakeholders and the wider community. This can help entities identify areas for improvement and take action to create more positive outcomes for all stakeholders.
