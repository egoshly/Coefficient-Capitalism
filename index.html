              Coefficient Capitalism is a modern economic system that aims to
              achieve a perfect balance between various factors to create
              sustainable, equitable, and prosperous growth. A coefficient of 0
              represents the ideal state of balance and harmony between
              economic, social, environmental, legal, and reputational factors,
              resulting in an economy that benefits all stakeholders without
              harming the environment or violating legal requirements.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white-50">
              Capitalism is an economic system that empowers individuals who
              have capital to fully develop, while those who do not have the
              possibility of accumulating capital are excluded or left in a
              precarious situation. The unequal distribution of profits
              generated by economic growth in capitalist economies is having a
              serious negative effect on democracy, since it undermines one of
              its fundamental principles: equality[3]. Income inequality is
              commonly measured by standard statistics as the Gini
              coefficient[1]. The Gini coefficient can theoretically range from
              0.0 to 1.0, with higher values indicating greater inequality[2].
              Different distributions of capital and labor describe different
              economic systems. Two polar systems are particularly relevant. In
              classical capitalism, a group of people receives incomes entirely
              from ownership, while another group receives incomes entirely from
              labor[4].
            </p>
            <p class="text-white-50">
              The Kuznets Curve predicts that as nations become wealthier,
              inequality initially rises and then declines[2]. However,
              economists hypothesized inequality would rise as workers
              transitioned from low-paying agricultural work to higher-paying
              industrial jobs but then decline as they moved into service
              jobs[2]. Unfortunately, this transition has stalled because
              educational costs have risen so much that less educated families
              are unable to gain the education required to complete the
              transition[2]. One interpretation of the data is that inequality
              naturally grows from unfettered capitalism[2].
            </p>
            <p class="text-white-50">
              In capitalist systems, norms of equality exist implicitly. The
              equality that exists in the standard form of utilitarianism can be
              interpreted as assigning the same positive coefficient to all
              individuals[5]. Classical capitalism tends to be associated with
              higher income inequality than liberal capitalism. Liberal
              capitalism lies between classical capitalism and homoploutic
              capitalism where compositional inequality is low and a society can
              be seen as homoploutic capitalism [4][1][5].
